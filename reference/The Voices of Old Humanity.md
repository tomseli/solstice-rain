# Overview
After humanity put their differences aside and [The Little Wars](The%20Little%20Wars.md) came to conclusion, [Union](Union.md) was created. The knowledge of the Massif Vaults was freely distributed across all people. 

Over time, researches revealed much of the story of [The Fall](The%20Fall.md) - of Old Humanity's desperate rush to preserve what it could so that that future generates could begin anew with the knowledge of who came before. 

Never a priority to [Union](Union.md) before, the stars took a new meaning: their ancestors might still be out there, and humanity might not be alone. With approval from the united communities of [Cradle](Cradle.md), whose representatives formed [Union](Union.md)'s [Central Committee](Union%20Central%20Committee.md) - The First Committee - [Union](Union.md) began began the great work of reaching those stars. 

They found old telescopes, radio towers and laser communication complexes preserved in deep ice on mountaintops and high places all over the world. They pointed them at the stars, turned them on, and waited.

The first messages arrived almost immediately, and with them came the third great trauma: the voices of Old Humanity, thousands of years ancient and dead, carried on signals garbled by radiation, time and distance, crying out to their home for help; lost souls that begged for aid, guidance and their loved once. Millenia of messages, recorded and playing on endless, decaying loops for the survivors to hear.
