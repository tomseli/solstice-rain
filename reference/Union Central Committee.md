# Overview
Broadly speaking, the [Third Committee](Third%20Committee.md)’s deliberative body, the Central Committee (CentComm), is composed of five major coalitions – groups of political parties and representatives organized into voting blocks. While working groups, break-outs, and caucuses exist within each group, the coalitions listed here provide a basis for what to expect when surveying CentComm’s political landscape.

The five major coalitions in order of size are:
1. [Interstellar](Interstellar.md)
2. [Fourth Column](Fourth%20Column.md)
3. [New Humanity Front](New%20Humanity%20Front.md)
4. [New Solidarity Coalition](New%20Solidarity%20Coalition.md)
5. [Verdant Social Arc](Verdant%20Social%20Arc.md)

Finally there's the [Independent Parties](Independent%20Parties.md). However, they exceed less then seven percent of total members.

Below CentComm are an enourmous amount of departments. All these departments are advised by Forecast/Galactic Simulation ([GALSIM](GALSIM.md)), all information then flows down to countless subordinate branches of [Union](Union.md)'s buraucracy.
