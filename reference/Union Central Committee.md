# Overview
Broadly speaking, the [[Third Committee]]’s deliberative body, the Central Committee (CentComm), is composed of five major coalitions – groups of political parties and representatives organized into voting blocks. While working groups, break-outs, and caucuses exist within each group, the coalitions listed here provide a basis for what to expect when surveying CentComm’s political landscape.

The five major coalitions in order of size are:
1. [[Interstellar]]
2. [[Fourth Column]]
3. [[New Humanity Front]]
4. [[New Solidarity Coalition]]
5. [[Verdant Social Arc]]

Finally there's the [[Independent Parties]]. However, they exceed less then seven percent of total members.

Below CentComm are an enourmous amount of departments. All these departments are advised by Forecast/Galactic Simulation ([[GALSIM]]), all information then flows down to countless subordinate branches of [[Union]]'s buraucracy.

The departments are:
- [[Union Administrative Department]]
- [[Union Naval Department]]
	- Union Naval Department Auxilliary Program
