# Overview
Massive generational colony ships. Launched in the dark age from [Earth](Cradle.md) toward distant planets, sparked by the inhospitable conditions on the [Cradle](Cradle.md). These ships were slow, but gave humanity a second chance.

After The Ten left the [Cradle](Cradle.md), [Earth](Cradle.md) fell. The then captains of The Ten decided it would be best for the passengers of these ships to isolate themselves, ceasing all communication with their home planet; a home left behind.

The first of The Ten to leave [Earth](Cradle.md) was called Apollo. It also arrived at its destination first, a world now known as Karrakis.

The last to leave [Earth](Cradle.md) was called Ãyãt. After it left the planet The Fall began.
