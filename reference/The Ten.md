# Overview
Massive generational colony ships. Launched in the dark age from [[Cradle|Earth]] toward distant planets, sparked by the inhospitable conditions on the [[Cradle]]. These ships were slow, but gave humanity a second chance.

After The Ten left the [[Cradle]], [[Cradle|Earth]] fell. The then captains of The Ten decided it would be best for the passengers of these ships to isolate themselves, ceasing all communication with their home planet; a home left behind.

The first of The Ten to leave [[Cradle|Earth]] was called Apollo. It also arrived at its destination first, a world now known as Karrakis.

The last to leave [[Cradle|Earth]] was called Ãyãt. After it left the planet The Fall began.
