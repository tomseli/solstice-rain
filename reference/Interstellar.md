# Overview
[ThirdComm](Third%20Committee.md)’s founding coalition, the Interstellar is both the largest coalition in [CentComm](Union%20Central%20Committee.md) and representative of the political ideology of most [Metropolitans](Metropolitan.md). In the nearly five centuries since the [Third Committee](Third%20Committee.md)’s foundation, the Interstellar has remained largely consistent in its adherence to the spirit of the Utopian Pillars – if not always their word. Under the Interstellar’s majority leadership, [Union](Union.md) has course-corrected away from SecComm’s imperial practices and toward a more hands-off approach to galactic affairs. The galaxy has once again become a polyglot, cosmopolitan network of thousands of worlds under [Union](Union.md)’s hegemony – though some would call it empire with kid gloves, instead of jackboots. While peace (mostly) reigns as a result of the Interstellar’s stewardship, complaints assail the moderate–left party from both flanks: to the radicals of the [New Solidarity Coalition](New%20Solidarity%20Coalition.md), the Interstellar has made too many concessions to the right wing; to the [Fourth Column](Fourth%20Column.md) and [New Humanity Front](New%20Humanity%20Front.md) factions, the Interstellar’s grip on galactic affairs is at once totalitarian, at once feeble. Regardless, membership in the Interstellar remains steady, and it comfortably commands 35 percent of [CentComm](Union%20Central%20Committee.md) representatives, with a vast and diverse constituency.
