# Overview
[[Third Committee|ThirdComm]]’s founding coalition, the Interstellar is both the largest coalition in [[Union Central Committee|CentComm]] and representative of the political ideology of most [[Metropolitan|Metropolitans]]. In the nearly five centuries since the [[Third Committee]]’s foundation, the Interstellar has remained largely consistent in its adherence to the spirit of the Utopian Pillars – if not always their word. Under the Interstellar’s majority leadership, [[Union]] has course-corrected away from SecComm’s imperial practices and toward a more hands-off approach to galactic affairs. The galaxy has once again become a polyglot, cosmopolitan network of thousands of worlds under [[Union]]’s hegemony – though some would call it empire with kid gloves, instead of jackboots. While peace (mostly) reigns as a result of the Interstellar’s stewardship, complaints assail the moderate–left party from both flanks: to the radicals of the [[New Solidarity Coalition]], the Interstellar has made too many concessions to the right wing; to the [[Fourth Column]] and [[New Humanity Front]] factions, the Interstellar’s grip on galactic affairs is at once totalitarian, at once feeble. Regardless, membership in the Interstellar remains steady, and it comfortably commands 35 percent of [[Union Central Committee|CentComm]] representatives, with a vast and diverse constituency.
