# Overview
An early offshoot from the [[Interstellar]], the Verdant Social Arc (VSA) is a coalition of parties that initially organized as an anti-colonial front in response to SecComm’s imperial flattening of thousands of Diasporan worlds. Since the creation of the Bureau of Colonial Administration, the VSA has transformed into a generalist social-democratic left coalition, more radical than the [[Interstellar]], but uncomfortable with [[New Solidarity Coalition|NSC]]’s radical rhetoric.

The VSA’s membership has declined steadily with each election since the founding of the [[New Solidarity Coalition|NSC]], as its member parties drift toward the center or further left. Currently, the VSA claims 15 percent of the representatives in the [[Union Central Committee|Central Committee]].

The members of the VSA are a dwindling group of more-than-moderate, not-quite-radical [[Metropolitan|Metropolitans]], isolationist Diasporans, and old [[Union Bureau of Colonial Administration|BCA]] personnel who have remained in public service.
