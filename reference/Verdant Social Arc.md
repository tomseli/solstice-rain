# Overview
An early offshoot from the [Interstellar](Interstellar.md), the Verdant Social Arc (VSA) is a coalition of parties that initially organized as an anti-colonial front in response to SecComm’s imperial flattening of thousands of Diasporan worlds. Since the creation of the Bureau of Colonial Administration, the VSA has transformed into a generalist social-democratic left coalition, more radical than the [Interstellar](Interstellar.md), but uncomfortable with [NSC](New%20Solidarity%20Coalition.md)’s radical rhetoric.

The VSA’s membership has declined steadily with each election since the founding of the [NSC](New%20Solidarity%20Coalition.md), as its member parties drift toward the center or further left. Currently, the VSA claims 15 percent of the representatives in the [Central Committee](Union%20Central%20Committee.md).

The members of the VSA are a dwindling group of more-than-moderate, not-quite-radical [Metropolitans](Metropolitan.md), isolationist Diasporans, and old [BCA](Union%20Bureau%20of%20Colonial%20Administration.md) personnel who have remained in public service.
