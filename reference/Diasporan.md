# Overview
Diasporan humans and their worlds are those that straddle the space between the Cosmopolitans, liminal in time and geography, and the [Metropolitans](Metropolitan.md), rooted in the Galactic Core. For Diasporan worlds, [Union](Union.md)'s utopia is an ongoing project – a future to be won through political and cultural struggle. How best to organize and assist the Diaspora toward [Union](Union.md)’s utopian vision is the question among the bureaucrats, administrators, and generals of the [Third Committee](Third%20Committee.md) – no one party or faction yet has the answer, and the solutions proposed seem to be as varied as the problems encountered. Just as geologically varied as the capital worlds of the Galactic Core, the many thousands of Diasporan worlds represent a second frontier: one not raw and unexploited, but steeped in their own histories, their own institutions, and their own ignorance or knowledge of [Union](Union.md).

In this power vacuum after the fall of SecComm, the immensity of human diaspora flourished: tens of thousands of colonial settlements grew to global civilizations. The once-lost stellar civilizations of Old Humanity, birthed by The Ten, stepped into interstellar prominence. Free from SecComm's colonial administration, these cultures and states developed divergent from [Union](Union.md)’s dogma. This is the Diaspora: New Humanity – both the known and the unknown to [Union](Union.md) – with a knowledge of [Union](Union.md) that ranges from living at utopia's periphery to living in ignorance of its existence. Diasporan worlds, while viewed by [ThirdComm](Third%20Committee.md) as member states of [Union](Union.md), often have little-to-no direct interaction with the hegemony. Those societies that remember the hegemon make myths of its distant power, some aching for its return and others cursing its name.

The diversity of development found across the Diaspora mirrors the diversity of these cultures and their histories. Some Diasporan worlds have small populations isolated in tiny communities, others span whole planets. A few even lay claim to neighboring moons and worlds in their local systems.
