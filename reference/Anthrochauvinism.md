# Overview
Broadly, Anthrochauvinism is a political ideology that adopts a manifest destiny approach to humanity’s existence on the galactic stage. Humanity, Anthrochauvinist thought dictates, survived hell and persevered; the Great Filter has passed over Humanity, tested it, and found it worthy of continuing on. As such, it is Humanity’s right to claim the stars and populate them freely: no ground that can be walked should be denied to Humanity’s standard-bearers. Humanity’s burden is the charge of the builder – create, expand, and carry all upon the shoulder. According to the proponents of this ideology, Humanity is the final judge: let humanity be all, and let all be as we are – in ensuring the survival of the species, the ends justify the means.

In practice, Anthrochauvinism tends to be a conservative, right-wing political and social ideology. [[Second Committee|SecComm]] emphasized strong central control, the development and maintenance of a strong military and civil service, adherence to its political objectives, and sacrifice for the good of the species. Humanity was defined as it expressed itself on [[Cradle]]; more often than not, this led to a dramatic flattening of language and expression, and the atomization, assimilation, and decontextualization of culture, dress, cuisine, religion, and arts. Cultural exchange was a tool deployed from [[Cradle]] to simplify management of the galaxy, with only the most “useful” artifacts of myriad cultures appropriated to bolster the aesthetic and ideological dominion of [[Cradle]]’s New Humanity.
