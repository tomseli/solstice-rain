# Overview
[Union](Union.md)'s imperative – spread life and ensure it – demands a marching frontier. As humanity spreads out toward the galaxy’s edge and toward its center, people establish settlements both in space and on firm ground. This population is the Cosmopolita; Cosmopolitans are those who live between, in transit to, or beyond this frontier. Their ships and flotillas are their homes, now or since birth. They may have left their homeworlds far behind in time and space, or they may have been born on a ship, with the void and stars the only homeland they've ever known.

Lacking reliable or ready access to blinkspace, these populations must travel the old way. This interstellar travel comes at the cost of time – time spent in transit between blink gates, traveling across the void of space, entombed in pause tanks, or awake and actively working as crew. The life of a Cosmopolitan is split between subjective time and realtime: time as they experience it, and time as it passes in the galaxy at large – this a consequence of conventional, near-c interstellar travel. Cosmopolitans trade the permanence and normality of a terrestrial life for one that is vast and uprooted – a life lived in the wind, dipping back into realtime only when they make port to trade, settle, or see what wonder the universe has crafted
