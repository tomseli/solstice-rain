# Overview
Paracausality is the cutting edge of science. Born from the debris of the Deimos Event, paracausal science gave rise to both the omninet and blinkspace travel. But what, exactly, is “paracausality”?

Causality is the relationship between cause and effect; paracausality references things abnormal to, adjacent to, or apart from cause and effect. Paracausality is a fuzzy science. It cannot be truly be explained without paraphrasing Arthur C. Clarke: it is so advanced – and so alien – that it is indistinguishable from magic.

Officially, paracausal studies are only a field of study within the walls of certain high-tier [USB](Union%20Science%20Bureau.md) campuses; however, in practice, certain corpro-states – Harrison Armory and HORUS in particular – are making inroads into this field without [Union](Union.md)’s approval. [Union](Union.md), meanwhile, monitors these and other paracausal research and development facilities via the [Union](Union.md) Aeronautics and Astronautics Advanced Development Projects Division on Ganymede. This campus, the “Skunkworks" for short, is a secret joint [USB](Union%20Science%20Bureau.md)/[UND](Union%20Naval%20Department.md) project that, in addition to monitoring outside paracausal development centers, engages in its own research and development programs.
