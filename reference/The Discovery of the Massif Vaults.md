# Overview
The Discovery of the Massif Vaults was the first of [The Three Great Traumas](The%20Three%20Great%20Traumas.md).

The Massif Vaults were vaults built by Old Humanity to store knowledge and artifacts of a bygone age. The discovery of the first Vault, Massif-A, in 150bu prompted societal rejuvenation. New Humanity learns they were in fact, not the first to live on the [Cradle](Cradle.md), but the last.

The knowledge of the Vault sparked an event that later became known as the second of [The Three Great Traumas](The%20Three%20Great%20Traumas.md); [The Little Wars](The%20Little%20Wars.md).
