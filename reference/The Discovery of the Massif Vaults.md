# Overview
The Discovery of the Massif Vaults was the first of [[The Three Great Traumas]].

The Massif Vaults were vaults built by Old Humanity to store knowledge and artifacts of a bygone age. The discovery of the first Vault, Massif-A, in 150bu prompted societal rejuvenation. New Humanity learns they were in fact, not the first to live on the [[Cradle]], but the last.

The knowledge of the Vault sparked an event that later became known as the second of [[The Three Great Traumas]]; [[The Little Wars]].
