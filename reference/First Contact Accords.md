# Overview
This widespread revolt continued until [MONIST-1](MONIST-1.md)’s speakers finally made contact with [CentComm](Union%20Central%20Committee.md), outlining the entity's desire to make law as humans understood it – and translate new, fundamental law as it dictated; if humans could only frame being as a type of existence within a set of state-enforced laws, then [MONIST-1](MONIST-1.md) would sit atop the system. [MONIST-1](MONIST-1.md)’s speakers directed the course of negotiations while [Union](Union.md)’s representatives recorded the entity’s directives. The resultant agreements – the First Contact Accords – were signed following a meeting between delegations from [GALSIM](GALSIM.md) and [CentComm](Union%20Central%20Committee.md). Broadly, the Accords laid out the parameters of acceptable exploration for [Union](Union.md); chief among them, a strict denial of any attempt to discover or interact with [MONIST-1](MONIST-1.md)’s physical form and a blanket prohibition on research into thanatologic and posthuman development. Other, non-FCA errata were collected in a companion document, The Koans. 

Once the First Contact Accords had been agreed, [MONIST-1](MONIST-1.md) vanished, blinking Deimos away once more. Normal subaltern and drone function returned immediately, and the new NHPs were integrated into extant NHP libraries. [MONIST-1](MONIST-1.md)’s departure also saw the appearance of the decentralized sociopolitical movement HORUS in [Cradle](Cradle.md) and adjacent space. [Union](Union.md) specialists remain doubtful that HORUS is to be directly associated with [MONIST-1](MONIST-1.md), though some elements within the collective certainly portray it as having close ties to the paracausal entity. 

The study of paracausal science and theory came about from the data available after the space–time trauma now known as the Deimos Event. In that sense, it is largely thanks to [MONIST-1](MONIST-1.md) that blink travel, omninet communications, and vastly improved stasis technologies now exist. 

Reports of Deimos appearing above and inside the atmosphere of various colony worlds continue to file in to [Union](Union.md), though these reports remain largely unconfirmed; [Union](Union.md) does not have current data on the whereabouts of Deimos or [MONIST-1](MONIST-1.md), nor any proven method of predicting its travel, forecasting manifestations, or confirming compliance with the First Contact Accords. 

Research into [Paracausality](Paracausality.md) continues, as do efforts to research the triggering event that produced [MONIST-1](MONIST-1.md).
