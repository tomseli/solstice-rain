# Overview
ThirdComm is the third iteration of [Union](Union.md)’s [Central Committee](Union%20Central%20Committee.md). It emerged from lengthy negotiations following the overthrow of the longest-ruling central government in [Union](Union.md)’s history – the Anthrochauvinist Second Committee.

ThirdComm is defined by its rejection of SecComm’s Anthrochauvinist values and its re-adoption of the Utopian Pillars. The old doctrine of aggressive colonial expansion and reconquest has been replaced with a hands-off approach to outreach, spearheaded by the [Union Administrative Department](Union%20Administrative%20Department.md) ([UAD](Union%20Administrative%20Department.md)). ThirdComm bore witness to SecComm’s crimes – the Hercynian Crisis, the PISTON-1 attack against the Aun that brought about the change from the First Committee to the Second, countless colonial suppressions. Its response has been to pursue a slower, more moderated path toward galactic integration. Recoiling from the naked aggression of its predecessor, ThirdComm places much more emphasis on hegemony – the exertion of cultural, political, and economic authority – relying on the soft powers of commerce, travel, and communication to bring the galaxy under [Union](Union.md)’s control.

Acceptance of the Utopian Pillars does not negate the need for violence or war – [Union](Union.md) maintains an active military and its planners expect to encounter a not-insignificant degree of resistance when interacting with post-SecComm cultures. Power never gives up power: ThirdComm, while it gives primacy to slow, diplomatic solutions (that are often unsatisfying to the petitioner), ultimately acknowledges that power, in some cases, must be taken from the powerful and redistributed to the people.

This dream has been fulfilled in some places, on some worlds; everywhere else, the realization of this project is [Union](Union.md)’s central goal. [Union](Union.md) is an incomplete project and human to its core. Despite every miracle of technology at its disposal, the fulfillment of this dream still requires people to make the right decisions, to be brave, to greet with compassion the myriad peoples so hurt by ThirdComm’s predecessors, and to build this grand project together.
