# Overview
OIT is a subordinate body of [[Union Bureau of Orbital and non-Terrestial Management|UBO/NTM]].

OIT is responsible for managing, planning, and maintaining the entirety of the blink network, installation of blink gates, and structuring safe passage codes for blink travel. It also sets and certifies safety standards for ships seeking interstellar licenses, and is the primary court for any cases involving temporal complexities – such as those concerning subjective/real age and death – and interstellar shipping disputes.
