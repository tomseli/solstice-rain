# Overview
The Union Science Bureau is the central administrative body for universities, colleges, scientific institutions, and think tanks throughout [[Union]] space. Ostensibly an apolitical entity, the USB works outside and parallel to [[Union Central Committee|CentComm]]’s chain of command, though it is subject to some oversight from [[Union Central Committee|CentComm]] and [[GALSIM]].

The most common site of interaction between the public and the USB is its exhausting list of colleges, universities, and public schools – however, it is most commonly represented in media in the form of the far-field team (FFT).

Although the popularity of rangers in romanticized omninet dramas drives USB recruitment, they make up a minority of USB personnel. The vast majority of USB staff are employed in terrestrial and orbital education centers, laboratories, and fabrication sites as researchers, engineers, designers, and technicians. The accessibility and secrecy of these institutions vary: most operate in the public eye, with doors wide open; by contrast, the campuses where the most secret and sensitive work takes place are hidden or otherwise inaccessible to those without clearance.
