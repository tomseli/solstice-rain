# Overview
In 4900bu, after the last of [The Ten](The%20Ten.md) left her homeplanet behind, The Fall began. This marked the end of Old Humanity.

[Earth](Cradle.md) fell to ruin due to climate change, lack of recources and disasters of both natural and man-made origin. Eventually it all went dark. The colonies on Mars and the Moon and spacestations in orbit, without the support of their homeplanet, eventually fell too.

However, humans are resilient, and not all was lost. Billions were reduced to hundreds of thousands, and technology reverted back to pre-industrial era. [Earth](Cradle.md) was a dark cloudy orb for millienia.

When the sky turned back to blue, life exploded. Trees burst out of the ground, becoming vast forests. Animals roamed on previously dead land, birds flew on recently polluted air and the mother of all life, the ocean, filled back with life.

Tribes became kingdoms, kingdoms became nations and nations... Well they went to war. However, now, at 150bum humanity stood at the doorstep of the first of the three great traumas.
