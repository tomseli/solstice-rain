# Overview
In 53bu, what mattered more to the power hungry tyrants was the technologies within The Vault. Soon, humanity suffered the second of [The Three Great Traumas](The%20Three%20Great%20Traumas.md), The Little Wars.

In it's conclusion, the survivors gathered up to pledge peace. To prevent humanity from killing the [Earth](Cradle.md) again, tools of war and capital were tossed aside. Borders and titles were left in history. No longer bound by nations or races, New Humanity had finally united together in trust and solidarity.

A new banner was raised. New Humanity started the foundation of its greatest project:

[Union](Union.md).
