# Overview
Cradle is [Union](Union.md)'s home world, the plane we call Earth.

Cradle and the system in which it can be found (Sol, or the Andes Core) are highly developed, densely populated, and dedicated to the daily maintenance, planning and operations of [Union](Union.md). Humanity's ancestral homeworld is the beating heart of the galactic hegemon: part memorial, part priviliged residence, part central hub.
