# Overview
The Union Department of Justice and Human Rights is a department new to [[Union]] as of the founding of [[Third Committee|ThirdComm]], cobbling together a mix of responsibilities, jurisdictions, and obligations under a single, broad mission: identify areas of the galaxy where the Utopian Pillars are under threat of being violated, and intervene on a case-by-case basis. Among its personnel, the DoJ/HR is referred to as the New Division – a dual reference to the general youth of its personnel and its (relatively) short history as a department.

The New Division’s mission leads to an understandably broad portfolio that encompasses everything from first contact with isolated cultures to critical humanitarian response, direct action intervention, truth and justice hearings, and universe reconstruction. This work demands a type of person common in the Galactic Core but not often found in other departments: young people eager for rapid action – policy, legal, or literal. Within [[Union]]’s other departments, few match the fervor with which the staff of the DoJ/HR approach their work; conversely, few – if any – of [[Union]]’s other departments can match the DoJ/HR’s burnout rate.

Burnout is a fact of the job at the DoJ/HR. The New Division is the terminus for the galaxy’s sins: every human rights violation, every distress call, every cry for help finds its way, eventually, to the DoJ/HR. To counteract this burnout, frontline personnel and caseworkers are often surprised with “delivery days”, unexpected deliveries from their commanding officers that contain collected reports from successfully resolved cases and personal messages from people their efforts have directly or indirectly helped.

The DoJ/HR’s mission is put into practice through a rich symbiotic relationship with the [[Union Administrative Department|UAD]] and the [[Union Naval Department|UN]]. Using access to the broad base of intelligence and human assets provided by the [[Union Administrative Department|UAD]] and the [[Union Naval Department|UN]] – as well as its own caseworkers – the New Division identifies two types of missions: [[Critical Assistance Missions]] and Universe-building missions.

Because the DoJ/HR’s portfolio straddles the purviews of both the [[Union Naval Department|UN]] and the [[Union Administrative Department|UAD]], many New Division operations involve resources from both of the other departments. In such cases, the New Division has the power to deputize naval and administrative personnel, vessels, and materiel.

# Notes
Although slavery is now strictly prohibited under [[Third Committee|ThirdComm]], it was once endorsed with special exception by SecComm, which viewed flash and facsimile clones as property rather than people. In addition to a number of other grievances that triggered [[Third Committee|ThirdComm]]’s revolution, the abolishment of SecComm’s endorsement of chattel and economic bondage was one of the revolutionaries’ primary demands.

The DoJ/HR oversees all active and ongoing emancipation missions. Before its founding, the DoJ/HR’s predecessors, the Interstellar Solidarity Brigades, developed a holistic liberation-to-integration program meant not only to liberate enslaved peoples, but to settle them, enfranchise them, address wealth redistribution, and support them throughout the recovery process. Now formally codified, legally supported, and bolstered by ongoing review by [[Third Committee|ThirdComm]], the DoJ/HR’s [[Liberator Teams]] boast a near perfect success rate in emancipatory actions.
