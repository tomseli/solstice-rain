# Overview
The Union Economic Bureau tracks and adjusts the value of manna, evaluates consumer goods, and has some jurisdiction over omninet and blink network affairs. It also plays a significant role in dealing with and legitimizing galactic-standard manufacturers and corpro-states For example, several advisory positions on the board of GMS are held ex-officio by UEB representatives, giving the bureau a say in its strategic direction and, as a direct consequence, a say in determining the galactic standards and codes.

More broadly, too, the UEB is responsible for regulating and contracting with corpro-states. Lesser known is its secondary, clandestine mission to gather intelligence on the galaxy’s largest corpro-states, suppliers, and fabricators.

Starting as a minor department under FirstComm, the UEB grew exponentially under SecComm – eventually spearheading the implementation of manna and chartering the first official corpro-states, recognizing their sovereignty over land and product. The UEB’s increasing consolidation of power is a point of friction for [CentComm](Union%20Central%20Committee.md); as [ThirdComm](Third%20Committee.md)’s rule has grown more assured over the centuries, and the first and second waves of post-revolution representatives have been replaced by new members, newer members have pushed to liberalize some of [Union](Union.md)’s components. The vehicle for this liberalization is the UEB, despite the growing number of high-level UEB personnel who espouse policies sympathetic to, and in some cases aligned entirely with Anthrochauvinist revival ideologies.
