# Overview
The Union Bureau of Orbital and Non-Terrestrial Management specializes in the management of nonterrestrial habitats and all relevant legislation. As part of this mission, it manages security and aide services on all non-terrestrial stations, including blink gates. The UBO/NTM is also the primary court for disputes concerning non-terrestrial natural or artificial habitats and stations in interstellar or non-local space.

The UBO/NTM has two subordinate bodies: the [Office of Interstellar Transportation](Office%20of%20Interstellar%20Transportation.md) (OIT) and the [Office of Cartography and Universal Positioning](Office%20of%20Cartography%20and%20Universal%20Positioning.md) (OCUP).
