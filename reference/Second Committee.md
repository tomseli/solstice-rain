# Overview
[[Union]] was not always as egalitarian as it is now; for thousands of years prior to the establishment of the [[Third Committee]], it was an empire in all but name. This was the age of the Second Committee – SecComm. Under SecComm, [[Union]] advanced humanity’s [[Diasporan|diaspora]] as a glacier scours the [[Cradle|earth]], flattening cultures left by Old Humanity, societies built by FirstComm, and all whose interpretation of [[Union]]’s founding tenets diverged from SecComm’s dogmatic proscriptions.

This [[Anthrochauvinism|expansionist ideology]] spread human life across whole regions of the Orion Arm, but without compassion and at the smoking mouth of a [[Union]] soldier's rifle. Humanity swept across the stars like a wave – only bloody revolution in the Galactic Core was able to topple SecComm, replacing it with a new government, [[Third Committee|ThirdComm]]. Only then, like a wave, did [[Union]]’s presence recede.
