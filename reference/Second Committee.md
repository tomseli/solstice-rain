# Overview
[Union](Union.md) was not always as egalitarian as it is now; for thousands of years prior to the establishment of the [Third Committee](Third%20Committee.md), it was an empire in all but name. This was the age of the Second Committee – SecComm. Under SecComm, [Union](Union.md) advanced humanity’s [diaspora](Diasporan.md) as a glacier scours the [earth](Cradle.md), flattening cultures left by Old Humanity, societies built by FirstComm, and all whose interpretation of [Union](Union.md)’s founding tenets diverged from SecComm’s dogmatic proscriptions.

This [expansionist ideology](Anthrochauvinism.md) spread human life across whole regions of the Orion Arm, but without compassion and at the smoking mouth of a [Union](Union.md) soldier's rifle. Humanity swept across the stars like a wave – only bloody revolution in the Galactic Core was able to topple SecComm, replacing it with a new government, [ThirdComm](Third%20Committee.md). Only then, like a wave, did [Union](Union.md)’s presence recede.
