# Overview
[Union](Union.md)’s bureaucracy is leviathan and infinitely complex. Executive power lies with [CentComm](Union%20Central%20Committee.md), now in its third iteration – [ThirdComm](Third%20Committee.md). By virtue of its home on Cradle, [CentComm](Union%20Central%20Committee.md) is largely isolated from the rest of the galaxy. [CentComm](Union%20Central%20Committee.md) is advised by Forecast/Galactic Simulation ([GALSIM](GALSIM.md)), and all information, edicts, advisement, and guidance flows down from there to the countless subordinate branches of [Union](Union.md)’s bureaucracy.

[Union](Union.md)'s galactic administration is made possible by three fundamental institutions: the blink network (faster-than-light travel), manna (a universal currency, used when necessary), and the Omninet (near-instant communications and data transfer). [Union](Union.md) uses these institutions to manage the affairs of the galaxy from the relatively small territory it directly controls; without them, the scattered bastions of humanity across the Orion Arm – the populated spur of the galaxy – would be separated by time and distance too great for [Union](Union.md) to manage. New Humanity would fracture into tens of thousands of individual states, some claiming scant territory on backwater colony worlds, others maintaining whole systems in the stars.

But [Union](Union.md) works toward a greater purpose than most know; it seeks to ensure human existence on a grand scale, following the guidance of its most powerful minds to ensure that humanity can spread across the stars and never again face a true existential threat. The vast apparatus of [Union](Union.md) works night and day to accomplish this goal for a simple reason: the threat of humanity’s extinction is very real and – if [Union](Union.md)’s most secret bureaus, organizations, and forecasters are to be believed – growing more likely.
