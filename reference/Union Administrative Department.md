# Overview
[[Union]]’s bureaucracy is leviathan and infinitely complex. Executive power lies with [[Union Central Committee|CentComm]], now in its third iteration – [[Third Committee|ThirdComm]]. By virtue of its home on Cradle, [[Union Central Committee|CentComm]] is largely isolated from the rest of the galaxy. [[Union Central Committee|CentComm]] is advised by Forecast/Galactic Simulation ([[GALSIM]]), and all information, edicts, advisement, and guidance flows down from there to the countless subordinate branches of [[Union]]’s bureaucracy.

[[Union]]'s galactic administration is made possible by three fundamental institutions: the blink network (faster-than-light travel), manna (a universal currency, used when necessary), and the Omninet (near-instant communications and data transfer). [[Union]] uses these institutions to manage the affairs of the galaxy from the relatively small territory it directly controls; without them, the scattered bastions of humanity across the Orion Arm – the populated spur of the galaxy – would be separated by time and distance too great for [[Union]] to manage. New Humanity would fracture into tens of thousands of individual states, some claiming scant territory on backwater colony worlds, others maintaining whole systems in the stars.

But [[Union]] works toward a greater purpose than most know; it seeks to ensure human existence on a grand scale, following the guidance of its most powerful minds to ensure that humanity can spread across the stars and never again face a true existential threat. The vast apparatus of [[Union]] works night and day to accomplish this goal for a simple reason: the threat of humanity’s extinction is very real and – if [[Union]]’s most secret bureaus, organizations, and forecasters are to be believed – growing more likely.
