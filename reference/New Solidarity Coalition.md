# Overview
The New Solidarity Coalition (NSC) is a young, growing coalition composed of new, radical representatives from Core and Diasporan worlds. Broadly speaking, these members advocate for a more direct, aggressive [Union](Union.md) that “fights for humanity” to ensure galaxy-wide adoption and ratification of the Utopian Pillars. Far-left and anarchist in ideology, the NSC often finds itself opposing New Humanity and the [Fourth Column](Fourth%20Column.md) in uneasy alliance with the [Verdant Social Arc](Verdant%20Social%20Arc.md) and the [Interstellar](Interstellar.md); however, it is not uncommon for the NSC to break with these erstwhile allies on questions of colonization, regulation, and diplomacy with various corpro-states, the Aunic problem, and matters concerning the Baronies, the Armory, and the Economic Bureau. The NSC claims 15 percent of the [Central Committee](Union%20Central%20Committee.md)’s representatives.

In the NSC, one might expect to find representatives sympathetic to the Albatross, [DoJ/HR](Union%20Department%20of%20Justice%20and%20Human%20Rights.md) [Liberator Teams](Liberator%20Teams.md), Horizon, and the Ungratefuls. Its power base is a coalition of young [Metropolitans](Metropolitan.md) dissatisfied with the slow progress and contradictory policies of the [Interstellar](Interstellar.md), old radical [Metropolitans](Metropolitan.md) who have always espoused permanent revolution, Diasporans opposed to corpro-states, and Diasporans who have adopted the early radical policies of the revolutionary Third‐ Comm. The NSC also commands a great deal of influence among [DoJ/HR](Union%20Department%20of%20Justice%20and%20Human%20Rights.md) personnel and some of the more radical administrators.
