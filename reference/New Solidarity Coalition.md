# Overview
The New Solidarity Coalition (NSC) is a young, growing coalition composed of new, radical representatives from Core and Diasporan worlds. Broadly speaking, these members advocate for a more direct, aggressive [[Union]] that “fights for humanity” to ensure galaxy-wide adoption and ratification of the Utopian Pillars. Far-left and anarchist in ideology, the NSC often finds itself opposing New Humanity and the [[Fourth Column]] in uneasy alliance with the [[Verdant Social Arc]] and the [[Interstellar]]; however, it is not uncommon for the NSC to break with these erstwhile allies on questions of colonization, regulation, and diplomacy with various corpro-states, the Aunic problem, and matters concerning the Baronies, the Armory, and the Economic Bureau. The NSC claims 15 percent of the [[Union Central Committee|Central Committee]]’s representatives.

In the NSC, one might expect to find representatives sympathetic to the Albatross, [[Union Department of Justice and Human Rights|DoJ/HR]] [[Liberator Teams]], Horizon, and the Ungratefuls. Its power base is a coalition of young [[Metropolitan|Metropolitans]] dissatisfied with the slow progress and contradictory policies of the [[Interstellar]], old radical [[Metropolitan|Metropolitans]] who have always espoused permanent revolution, Diasporans opposed to corpro-states, and Diasporans who have adopted the early radical policies of the revolutionary Third‐ Comm. The NSC also commands a great deal of influence among [[Union Department of Justice and Human Rights|DoJ/HR]] personnel and some of the more radical administrators.
