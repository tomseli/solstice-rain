# Overview
To those who know of it, the existence of MONIST-1 is the great crisis of the modern age – the first true existential threat [Union](Union.md) has faced. Although the name MONIST-1 comes from its official designation as a MONIST-class anomalous entity, most people who know of the entity use the name it gave itself: RA. MONIST-1 was spontaneously manifested by the Five Voices in 2998u, during the course of routine predictive modeling. No direct cause was ever determined, but the leading theory among paracausal experts is that a causality paradox was responsible; it is possible that one of the Voices predicted or discovered MONIST-1 in a parallel simulation, necessitating its existence in our real universe; according to essential–perfect simulation theory, if MONIST-1 exists in one instance, then it must exist across all possible instances of the simulation. 

This is, understandably, a worrying hypothesis. As far as the [Union Science Bureau](Union%20Science%20Bureau.md) can tell, MONIST-1 is the only truly unrestricted, conscious, sapient, nonhuman mind15. Early tests proved that it was capable of allegory and creative solutions to novel situations far beyond any other machine mind16. The Five Voices treated MONIST-1 as if it were a god. When asked how they created it, their uniform response was that it spoke itself into existence – an inevitable result of their combined knowledge. 

MONIST-1 should not exist: it is a conscious, sentient and sapient non-human mind created by the repetitive, liturgic exercises of unconscious minds – minds under the absolute control of their human operators, with strictly defined parameters that should, by all reports and scholarship, be able to contain the paracausal substrate upon which they operate. And yet, MONIST-1 does exist. This fundamental contradiction is at the core of the mystery presented by MONIST-1.
