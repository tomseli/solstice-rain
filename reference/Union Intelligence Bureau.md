# Overview
The Union Intelligence Bureau (UIB) is [[Union]]â€™s deniable asset and dark operations group: a broad portfolio, clandestine intelligence division that keeps tabs on entities, states, phenomena, organizations, and movements that [[GALSIM]] determines to represent major existential threats to humanity. [[Union Central Committee|CentComm]] only has an advisory-oversight role to the UIB; ultimate decision-making falls first to [[GALSIM]], then to the UIB itself.

Officially, the UIB does not exist; even [[Union Central Committee|CentComm]] is not privileged to know how it staffs itself, nor the full extent of its missions.
