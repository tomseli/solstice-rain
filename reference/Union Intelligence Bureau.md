# Overview
The Union Intelligence Bureau (UIB) is [Union](Union.md)â€™s deniable asset and dark operations group: a broad portfolio, clandestine intelligence division that keeps tabs on entities, states, phenomena, organizations, and movements that [GALSIM](GALSIM.md) determines to represent major existential threats to humanity. [CentComm](Union%20Central%20Committee.md) only has an advisory-oversight role to the UIB; ultimate decision-making falls first to [GALSIM](GALSIM.md), then to the UIB itself.

Officially, the UIB does not exist; even [CentComm](Union%20Central%20Committee.md) is not privileged to know how it staffs itself, nor the full extent of its missions.
