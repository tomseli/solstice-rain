# Overview
Critical assistance missions (CAMs) take place when impending or ongoing violation events necessitate rapid, direct action to intervene and prevent further human cost. These warrant the intervention of one of the [DoJ/HR](Union%20Department%20of%20Justice%20and%20Human%20Rights.md)’s [Liberator Teams](Liberator%20Teams.md) (LTs), institutionalized successors to [ThirdComm](Third%20Committee.md)’s early Interstellar Solidarity Brigades. For most New Division personnel, CAMs are “where the action is at” – that is, they are violent confrontations with slavers (note), despots, tyrants, and so on. [LTs](Liberator%20Teams.md) are commonly composed of [Metropolitan](Metropolitan.md) volunteers working in tandem with local sympathetic factions. Their missions call for rapid movement, adogmatic warfare, and long-term deployment; not only do they intervene, but they remain following the conclusion of hostilities, helping to transition liberated communities into stable political entities appropriate for the local culture.
