# Overview
Cressidium is a [Cradle](reference/Cradle.md)-type planet along the Cascade Line (Ring 10). It is fortunate enough to boast natural conditions suitable for habitation, with a diverse, human-compatible climate and biosphere and a variety of flora and fauna, including both native specimens along with those introduced during colonization. Like [Cradle](reference/Cradle.md), its surface is largely covered by water interspersed with large continental landmasses and island chains. The human population of the planet has grown over the last 500 years to form a number of large nations and power blocs, including the [Leandric States Alliance](Leandric%20States%20Alliance.md) (LSA), the [Vestan Sovereignty](Vestan%20Sovereignty.md), and the Republic of Okasnia.

Societally, Cressidium has been largely isolationist until recently. Though knowledge of other humans existing across the galaxy isn’t suppressed information, most assume that [Union](reference/Union.md) inevitably collapsed in the wake of the revolutionary movement against the [Second Committee](reference/Second%20Committee.md), and that remaining obscure and unnoticed is vital to protect the planet against any number of marauding, vengeful splinter nations. As a result, Cressidium’s spacefaring capabilities have historically been fairly minimal, generally relegated to satellite launches, though within the last century more development in this area has taken place as conservative attitudes have waned. The planet now boasts several space elevators and the major powers have all made headway in developing their own surface-launched space-capable ships, roughly equivalent to what [Union](reference/Union.md) would classify as corvette-tier vessels. These are used largely in a deterrence role along with limited anti-satellite and orbit-to-surface strike capabilities.

Despite its long isolation and lack of omninet access, Cressidium’s technological development has generally kept pace with wider galactic trends. At the time, mechs had just entered into military service with the use of the Genghis Mk I during the Hercynian Crisis. Over the course of the 500 years that followed, Cressidium’s various nations have developed their own mechs that, despite their divergent evolution, are generally comparable to those in use elsewhere. The biggest differences lie in their grasp of paracausal science, which is notably lacking compared to their [Union](reference/Union.md) counterparts. While the early colonial efforts possessed printers that were, at the time, cutting edge, without replacements they eventually fell into disrepair, leaving things entirely to conventional manufacturing. Access to modern printer technology is among the benefits [Union](reference/Union.md) is offering should Cressidium ultimately decide to join them.
