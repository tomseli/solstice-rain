# Overview
First met in a shelter/millitary base near [FOB Saber](FOB%20Saber.md) in [Nov Elysia](Nov%20Elysia.md).

# Notes
**Questions log:**
Us:
 *We need intelligence regarding the trainyard.*
*We need updated maps.*
*We need intelligence on the high energy beam.* 

Zheng:
*"We have control of the lower districts. The port and upper districts are cut off. We know your people have set up an FOB here, at the other side of the train yard. We also have information that there are clusters of [Union](reference/Union.md) and [LSA](Leandric%20States%20Alliance.md) here, here and here."*
*"Enemies have fortified the train yard and are using it as their own operating base. There's about a platoon set up there. Mostly crew position, but also some frames. They have been funneling in civilian and military prisoners inside to prevent us from deploying heavy duty weaponry."*
*"They've also set op their main AA position next to there, to the North-west to assure sight lines. And secondary manpad positions here, here, here, and here."*
*"They're using a Tyfonas mobile missile platform as their anchor."*
*"We have video of it from one of our recon elements."*

Video:
A grainy film appears. Some soldiers moving low and slow. Ahead of them is a sub depot, through which is the most direct route to [FOB Saber](FOB%20Saber.md), and perched aboard a train car is a mechanized chassis outfitted with missile launchers. A [Union](reference/Union.md) dropship flies overhead, part of the first wave dispatched from the Rio Grande. Theyâ€™ve made it farther into the city by air than the party did, but with no way to punch through the comms jamming, the PCs can only watch as the mech takes position, tracks the dropship, and launches a salvo of missiles at it. The pilots attempt to evade, but like their own dropship it takes fire and begins to fall. Moments later, the PCs hear the crash and a plume of smoke begins to rise in the distance.

Zheng:
*"Concerning the energy weapon. We don't know a lot about it but it is land based, attached to a frame. It seems to be a specialized anti-lancer weapon."*
*"We haven't had eyes on it since a couple of hours ago when it engaged some [Union](reference/Union.md) drop ships."*
