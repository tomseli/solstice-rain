# Overview


# Notes
**Questions:**
Describe the airborne forces.

*"Hmm, the deployed forces here are from the [11th Territorial Battalion](11th%20Territorial%20Battalion.md). Their pilots are relatively inexperience and are few in numbers. Usually deploying in Ace's of the bomber variety; they like to zip over you and drop their heavier ordinance."*

What about the [409th Irregulars](409th%20Irregulars.md)?

*"Hmm, I've heard you've run into [Cerberus](409th%20Irregulars.md). Though I am surprised; their unit was disbanded a decade ago after suffering catastrophic losses during Operation Juniper. I didn't know many of them are still around."*
*"You've met [Talos](Wulf.md). Notable others were Athena, Ares, Hermes and Dionysus."*
*"Though Ares was confirmed to have perished, and Dionysus is rumored to have retired."*
*"While they are known to switch out their frames, their composition is usually similar. Ares liked to get up close and personal, Athena was their heavy hitter. [Talos](Wulf.md) controlled the battlefield from close to mid range. Dionysus provided air support and Hermes was their cyberops specialist."**
