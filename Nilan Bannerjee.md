# Overview
Ambassadorial activities, including diplomatic negotiations with [Diasporan](reference/Diasporan.md) states and recontact/reintegration missions, fall under the purview of the [Union](reference/Union.md) Administrative Department, and the [UAD](reference/Union%20Administrative%20Department.md)’s representative for the [Cressidium](Cressidium.md) mission is Nilan Bannerjee. Where administrators are assigned to single worlds or sectors, ambassadors travel wherever their skills are needed; as such, Bannerjee has seen dozens of worlds in a life spent traveling the stars and bridging gaps between peoples and nations. Widely traveled as they are, recontact with a previously lost world considering [Union](reference/Union.md) membership isn’t something that happens every day, and this momentous occasion will hinge upon their diplomatic prowess.

This assignment may be one of the most challenging they’ve been tasked with in their career, and the stakes are suitably high; facilitating an accord between the [LSA](Leandric%20States%20Alliance.md) and the [Sovereignty](Vestan%20Sovereignty.md) won’t just mean the likely admittance of [Cressidium](Cressidium.md) into [Union](reference/Union.md) but will put an end to decades of simmering tensions, proxy skirmishes, and the threat of all-out war. For any diplomat, a success here would be the crowning achievement of a career. The ambassador has traveled to [Cressidium](Cressidium.md) aboard their own vessel along with their own diplomatic staff, but they periodically shuttle over to the Rio Grande to conduct meetings with the senior officers.
