# Notes
**Interrogation notes:**
COL S. Kiros freezes up as his eyes glass over, raising his mangled hand.

*"We see you. We who walk the fields. You have cut away two fingers, but the fist remains."*
*"You think you know us, but you are wrong. We shall emerge from our cocoons and take what is rightfully ours. We are many, we are one."*

COL S. Kiros as his eyes roll back he continues chanting.

*"We are many, we are one. We are many we are one. Wearemany we are one. Wearemanyweareone..."*

These symptoms were described before as someone who was flashcloned. If this happens too many times, one may lose their identity or be linked to their clones.
There has to be at least one more version of Kiros. Since we know there a three fury's, we killed one, we captured one, there should be one remaining.

*"Eternity is nigh, the chosen shall walk the blessed lands"*
