# Overview
The Sovereignty is an oppressive and expansionistic power founded by the descendants of military and political leaders who had fled to [[Cressidium]] to escape the collapse of [[Second Committee|SecComm]]. Information on [[Cressidium]]’s location and its colonization was purged by those who fled there in an attempt to cover their tracks. After centuries of infighting, as authoritarian governments rose and fell the spiritual successor of [[Second Committee|SecComm]] emerged. Dubbed the Vestan Sovereignty, or the Sovereignty for short.

The [[Leandric States Alliance|LSA]] and the Sovereignty are presently engaged in a cold war going back decades. Both states were established during a period of civil instability and warfare over land and resources known as the Barren Years. Over time, the political situation on [[Cressidium]] stabilized around these major power blocs, leading to the planet’s present state of affairs. For a time it seemed that the Vestan Sovereignty’s authoritarian government was losing its hold, giving way to something more progressive, and there were even hopes of long-term peace talks in the future. A recent series of assassinations and internal power struggles has, however, prompted a renewed wave of hardline nationalism and neo-anthrochauvinist sentiment, vying against the older and less outwardly aggressive regime for control of the nation. The current relationship between the major powers is tense, but not to the point of outright war, and representatives of the Vestan Sovereignty have agreed to attend talks along with the [[Leandric States Alliance|LSA]] during this diplomatic mission.
