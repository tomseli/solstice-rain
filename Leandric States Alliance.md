# Overview
The Leandric States Alliance (LSA) began as an alliance of smaller nation-states against the [[Vestan Sovereignty]], and has grown out to one of the superpowers on [[Cressidium]]. Many of its nations have cast off the anthrochauvinistic attitudes of their forebears and adopted more egalitarian policies in line with those of the [[reference/Third Committee]]. They are the driving force in the negotiations with [[reference/union|Union]].

The LSA and the [[Vestan Sovereignty|Sovereignty]] are presently engaged in a cold war going back decades. Both states were established during a period of civil instability and warfare over land and resources known as the Barren Years. Over time, the political situation on [[Cressidium]] stabilized around these major power blocs, leading to the planetâ€™s present state of affairs.
