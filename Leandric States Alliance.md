# Overview
The Leandric States Alliance (LSA) began as an alliance of smaller nation-states against the [Vestan Sovereignty](Vestan%20Sovereignty.md), and has grown out to one of the superpowers on [Cressidium](Cressidium.md). Many of its nations have cast off the anthrochauvinistic attitudes of their forebears and adopted more egalitarian policies in line with those of the [Third Committee](reference/Third%20Committee.md). They are the driving force in the negotiations with [Union](reference/Union.md).

The LSA and the [Sovereignty](Vestan%20Sovereignty.md) are presently engaged in a cold war going back decades. Both states were established during a period of civil instability and warfare over land and resources known as the Barren Years. Over time, the political situation on [Cressidium](Cressidium.md) stabilized around these major power blocs, leading to the planetâ€™s present state of affairs.
