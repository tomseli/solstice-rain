# Overview
Big angry Gunnery Sergeant. Not one for pleasantries.

# Notes
Missions briefing at [FOB Saber](FOB%20Saber.md):

*"It’s time to do something about the jamming that’s been blanketing the city; as long as it remains, there are concerns that, lacking the ability to properly coordinate, the [LSA](Leandric%20States%20Alliance.md)’s push to retake the central district will be picked apart. Based on intel gathered from various [Union](reference/Union.md) squads following their arrival at [FOB Saber](FOB%20Saber.md), it seems the [Sovereignty](Vestan%20Sovereignty.md) has deployed a network of jamming transmitter units throughout the city. Some squads managed to destroy several that they encountered on their way to the base, but that wasn’t enough to bring the network down."*
*"In order to neutralize the jamming, the entire transmitter network is going to need to be taken offline. Fortunately, Rio has put together a viral code-spike package that should be capable of disabling the network from a single transmission point. Once loaded onto your mechs, all you need to do is find a transmitter unit and upload the program, which will happen automatically. However, this will require close proximity access in order to establish a clean link, which means finding and securing a transmitter long enough for the program to upload itself."*
*"RIO believes there to be a jamming transmitter located within striking distance of [FOB Saber](FOB%20Saber.md) that is lightly defended, as [Sovereignty](Vestan%20Sovereignty.md) forces are heavily reinforcing other areas, including airborne units patrolling the area. Once you have finished checking over your mechs and all preparations are complete, you’re heading back out into the city to take this transmitter and shut down the jamming once and for all."*
