# Overview
Mysterious person on board the submarine. Guarded by Ares, [[409th Irregulars]].



# Notes
**Intel:**
Security camera's, routed through the harbor master's office, show a familiar group of frames arriving and unloading hostages from some kind of transport vehicle as the sub emerges.

You recognize the [[Nilan Bannerjee|Ambassador]] and a group of various VIPS. Some of you recognize the king of one of the smaller nations that make part of the [[Leandric States Alliance|LSA]], and if you read the tabloids a popular playboy billionaire.
