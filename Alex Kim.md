# Overview
The executive officer aboard the Rio Grande, 1st Lieutenant Alex Kim hasn’t served as long or had as storied a career as Captain [Farris](Brigid%20Farris.md), though he wouldn’t be XO if he lacked the necessary qualifications. Promoted to the post relatively recently, Kim is eager to prove that he’s up to the task – perhaps a bit too eager if you were to ask some of the ship’s personnel who’ve found themselves on the receiving end of yet another pep talk or by-the-book lecture about regulations. They’re hoping that some of the captain’s self-assurance will rub off on him and he’ll start to relax more into the role, ideally sooner rather than later.
