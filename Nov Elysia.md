# Overview
Nov Elysia is a modern, coastal city with a number of major ports, on par with any Core world metropolis. Tall, gleaming buildings rise over precisely ordered streets and thoroughfares, all built in a grandiose, somewhat outsized architectural style that hints at the planet’s [SecComm](reference/Second%20Committee.md) history. The city’s population numbers in the millions, and it houses a number of core [LSA](Leandric%20States%20Alliance.md)’s institutions, including their General Assembly and their high court. While not the largest, or most important city in [LSA](Leandric%20States%20Alliance.md) territory, it has great symbolic value as one of the first settlements on [Cressidium](Cressidium.md). Because of this symbolic value, and its extensive global infrastructure, the city is often used as the primary location for [LSA](Leandric%20States%20Alliance.md)-[Sovereignty](Vestan%20Sovereignty.md) talks.
