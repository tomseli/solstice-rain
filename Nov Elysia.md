# Overview
Nov Elysia is a modern, coastal city with a number of major ports, on par with any Core world metropolis. Tall, gleaming buildings rise over precisely ordered streets and thoroughfares, all built in a grandiose, somewhat outsized architectural style that hints at the planet’s [[Second Committee|SecComm]] history. The city’s population numbers in the millions, and it houses a number of core [[Leandric States Alliance|LSA]]’s institutions, including their General Assembly and their high court. While not the largest, or most important city in [[Leandric States Alliance|LSA]] territory, it has great symbolic value as one of the first settlements on [[Cressidium]]. Because of this symbolic value, and its extensive global infrastructure, the city is often used as the primary location for [[Leandric States Alliance|LSA]]-[[Vestan Sovereignty|Sovereignty]] talks.
